                        <h2>How it was made:</h2>
                        The website layout was made using flexbox in css. Other things such as the navigation were also made using CSS.
                        <br>
                        <h3>Home Page:</h3>
                        The Home page is a small little intro generally explaining what the site is about. It also includes a little intro to myself.
                        <br>
                        <h3>AV Page:</h3>
                        The AV page shows you some videos that relate to some of my hobbies and interests. Video Games and Tech Youtubers are the reason for my interest
                        in the industry and they are a big factor to who I am today.

                        <h3>JavaScript Page:</h3>
                        This page will contain a form that will ask for certain inputs from you. I will be using verification methods using JavaScript and CSS.
                        <br>
                        <h3>Dynamic Content:</h3>
                        This page will contain some sort of dynamic content created using JavaScript.
